# 4-1. Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. 
# Store these pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print 
# the name of each pizza.
# • Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza,
# instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza, you should 
# have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.
# • Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states 
# how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines 
# about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as
# I really love pizza!

favorite_pizza : list = ["margherita", "fiori di zucca", "marinara"]

for n in favorite_pizza:

# 4-2. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a 
# common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, 
# and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.
# • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog 
# would make a great pet.
# • Add a line at the end of your program, stating what these animals have in 
# common. You could print a sentence, such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

animal_list : list = ["dog", "cat", "rabbit"]

# 4-3. Counting to Twenty: Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20, inclusive.

print("this loop print all numbers from n to n")
number : int = int(input("inserisci un numero"))

for n in range(1, number +1) :
    print(n)
  

# 4-4. One Million: Make a list of the numbers from one to one million,
# and then use a for loop to print the numbers. (If the output is taking too long, 
# stop it by pressing CTRL-C or by closing the output window.)

#number= list(range(1,1000001))
#for n in number:

#    print(n)

# 4-5. Summing a Million: Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, 
# and then use min() and max() to make sure your list actually starts at one
# and ends at one million. Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly Python 
# can add a million numbers.    


number = list(range(1,1000001))
x = min(number)
print(f"questo è il minimo {x}")
y = max(number)

# 4-6. Odd Numbers: Use the third argument of the range()
# function to make a list of the odd numbers from 1 to 20. Use a
# for loop to print each number.

number_list = [number for number in range(1, 20, 2)]

for n in number_list:
    print(n)



# 4-7. Threes: Make a list of the multiples of 3, from 3 to 30. 
# Use a for loop to print the numbers in your list.


number_list = [number for number in range(3, 31, 3)]

for n in number_list :
    print(n)


# 4-8. Cubes: A number raised to the third power is called a cube. 
# For example, the cube of 2 is written as 2**3 in Python. Make a list
# of the first 10 cubes (that is, the cube of each integer from 1 through 10),
# and use a for loop to print out the value of each cube.    

#number_list = [number**3 for number in range(1, 10)]

for number in range(1,10):
    number_list.append(number**3)

for n in number_list :
    print(n)    


# 4-9. Cube Comprehension: Use a list comprehension to generate a list
# of the first 10 cubes.

number_list = [number**3 for number in range(1, 10)]

for n in number_list :
    print(n)


# 4-10. Slices: Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, 
# add several lines to the end of the program that do the following:
# • Print the message The first three items in the list are:. Then use 
# a slice to print the first three items from that program’s list.
# • Print the message Three items from the middle of the list are:. Then
# use a slice to print three items from the middle of the list.
# • Print the message The last three items in the list are:. Then use a 
# slice to print the last three items in the list.


number_list = list(range(1,30))

print(f"primi tre numeri {number_list[:3]}")
